Welcome to my multi-task web project! Within this repository, you'll find a single web page that seamlessly integrates five diverse tasks. From a user-friendly landing page with interactive features to a stopwatch, Tic-Tac-Toe game, personal portfolio website, and weather app integration, our project showcases our skills in front-end development. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each task is designed to be responsive, functional, and visually appealing. Explore our codebase to see how we've crafted a unified and engaging web experience for users.
